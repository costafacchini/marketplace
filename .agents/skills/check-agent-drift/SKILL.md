# Check Agent Drift

## Context Required
FULL-CONTEXT: AGENTS.md + relevant KB

## Setup

1. Load `.agents/memory/project-profile.md` (always)
2. Load `.agents/memory/decisions.md` if this skill touches architecture
3. Check `docs/kb/README.md`; read any matching doc before grepping code
4. Explore codebase patterns only after steps 1–3

Skip steps not relevant to this skill's scope.

## Triggers

### Automatic
- None (resource-intensive, run on request)

### Manual
- `/check-agent-drift`
- "run check-agent-drift"
- "verify agents.md"
- "is our documentation current?"
- "check for drift"
- Periodically during long projects

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse AGENTS.md sections
- Commands and their expected behavior
- File paths and patterns
- Conventions and constraints
- Integration details

### Step 2: Verify Commands section
- For each documented slash command / skill:
  - Verify the referenced skill or doc file exists
  - Verify the command name matches the deployed skill/command mapping
  - Flag stale aliases, missing files, or renamed commands

### Step 3: Verify File Patterns section
- Check that listed paths exist
- Flag paths that don't exist or have moved

### Step 4: Verify Conventions against recent code
- Sample recent commits (last 20)
- Check if commits follow documented patterns
- Flag patterns that diverge from documentation

### Step 5: Scan for undocumented patterns
- Look for new directories not in AGENTS.md
- Look for new conventions in recent PRs
- Check for new integrations or services

### Step 6: Check constraints accuracy
- Verify documented constraints are still valid
- Check for changed infrastructure or requirements

### Step 7: Generate drift report

```text
AGENTS.md Drift Check
=====================

Checking against codebase state...

DRIFT DETECTED:

[STALE_PATH] Line 45
  Documented: app/workers/report_worker.rb
  Reality: File moved to app/workers/reports/generate_worker.rb
  SUGGESTION: Update path reference

[MISSING_PATTERN] Recent commits
  Pattern found: New convention in codebase
  Not documented in AGENTS.md
  SUGGESTION: Add documentation

[OUTDATED_COMMAND] Line 23
  Documented: old command
  Reality: Command changed
  SUGGESTION: Update command

NO DRIFT:

[OK] Section 1 - accurate
[OK] Section 2 - confirmed

=====================
N drift issues found, M sections verified OK

Would you like me to apply suggested fixes?
```

### Step 8: Offer to apply fixes
- Show proposed AGENTS.md changes
- Apply with user confirmation

## Output

- Detailed drift report to console
- Specific AGENTS.md line references
- Actionable suggestions with proposed text
- Option to auto-apply fixes

## Examples

User: "Let's make sure our docs are up to date"

Agent runs the drift check and reports findings with specific line references and suggestions for each issue found.
