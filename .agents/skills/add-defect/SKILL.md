# Add Defect

## Context Required
MEDIUM-CONTEXT: Plan overview, existing task list, bug description from user

## Setup

1. Load `.agents/memory/project-profile.md` (always)
2. Load `.agents/memory/decisions.md` if this skill touches architecture
3. Check `docs/kb/README.md`; read any matching doc before grepping code
4. Explore codebase patterns only after steps 1–3

Skip steps not relevant to this skill's scope.

## Triggers

### Automatic
- None (manual only)

### Manual
- `/add-defect {plan-slug} "{bug description}"`
- `/add-defect {plan-slug} --blocks {task-path} "{bug description}"`
- `/add-defect {plan-slug} {JIRA-KEY}`
- "add a bug to the plan"
- "found a bug in {plan-slug}"
- "QA found an issue with..."
- "this plan has a defect"

## When to Use This vs /investigate-bug

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Bug is in code that THIS PLAN delivered or changed | `/add-defect` — the plan owns it |
| Bug blocks a task in this plan from completing | `/add-defect --blocks {task-path}` |
| Bug is a production issue unrelated to any active plan | `/investigate-bug` |
| Bug needs deep investigation (root cause unclear) | `/investigate-bug` |
| Bug is trivial (1 file, obvious fix, <30 min) | Just fix it — no plan or defect needed |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Load Plan Context

1. Read `.plans/{plan-slug}/overview.md` for the plan's current state
2. Read the Task Summary table to understand existing tasks and numbering
3. If a JIRA key was provided, fetch the ticket for details

### Step 2: Gather Bug Details

If not provided as arguments, ask for:
- **What's broken**: Clear description of the bug
- **Where it was found**: Which task's deliverables, which feature area, repro steps
- **Blocks**: Does this block an existing task? Which one?
- **Severity**: P0-P3 (P0 = critical/data loss, P1 = major blocking, P2 = significant, P3 = minor)
- **JIRA**: Ticket key if one exists (or should one be created?)

### Step 3: Create Defect Task

1. **Assign the next task number** — Find the highest `task-{NN}` number across all tasks in the plan (including any phase subdirectories) and increment.

2. **Generate the task slug**: `task-{NN}-defect-{2-3-word-description}`

3. **Determine placement**:
   - Flat plan (no phases): Place in plan root
   - Phased plan: Place in the same phase as the task it blocks, or the latest phase if it doesn't block anything

4. **Create the task directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .plans/{plan-slug}/{task-path}
   ```

5. **Write `task.md`** from the defect task template (see below)

6. **Write `status.md`** — Standard status template, set to `not-started`

### Step 4: Update Plan Overview

1. **Task Summary table** — Add the defect task row:
   ```markdown
   | {task-path} | Defect: {title} | {phase} | not-started | {blocked-task or "—"} |
   ```

2. **Defects table** — Add an entry:
   ```markdown
   | {task-path} | {title} | {found-during or "QA"} | {blocks or "—"} | not-started |
   ```

3. **If the defect blocks an existing task**:
   - Read that task's `status.md`
   - If the task is `in-progress`, add a blocker entry: "Blocked on {defect-task-path}: {description}"
   - If the task is `complete` or `adapted`, the defect is a regression — note this in the defect task context

### Step 5: Git Operations

Plan metadata goes directly to main:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git add .plans/{plan-slug}/{task-path}/task.md .plans/{plan-slug}/{task-path}/status.md .plans/{plan-slug}/overview.md
# If the defect blocks a task whose status.md was updated, add it before committing:
# git add .plans/{plan-slug}/{blocked-task-path}/status.md
git commit -m "plan({plan-slug}): add defect {task-path}"
git push origin main
```

### Step 6: Report

Present to the user:
- Defect task path and title
- What it blocks (if anything)
- Severity
- Suggest next step: `/execute-task {plan-slug}/{defect-task-path}`

## Defect Task Template

```markdown
# Task: Defect — [TITLE]

**Plan**: [Plan name]
**Task ID**: task-[NN]
**Task Path**: task-[NN]-defect-[slug]
**Depends On**: "None"
**Blocks**: [task-path] or "None"
**JIRA**: [JIRA-KEY] or "N/A"
**Severity**: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
**Found By**: [name or "QA"]
**Found During**: [task-path, "QA testing", or "code review"]

## Bug Description

[What's broken, how to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior]

## Root Cause

<!-- Brief if known, "TBD — needs investigation" if not.
     If this needs deep investigation, consider /investigate-bug instead. -->

**File**: [path] (lines [N-M]) or "TBD"
**What it does**: [current behavior]
**What it should do**: [expected behavior]

## File Ownership

| File | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| [path] | modify | [Brief note] |

### Do NOT Modify

- [Files owned by sibling tasks]

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix
[Specific fix instructions, or investigation steps if root cause is TBD]

### Step 2: Regression Test
[Test that fails before fix, passes after]

## Testing

- [ ] Regression test added (fails before, passes after)
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
- [ ] `pre-commit-check` passes
- [ ] Original repro steps no longer reproduce the bug

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Bug fixed
- [ ] Regression test added
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] Changes committed to `plan/[slug]/[task-path]` branch
- [ ] Status updated in `status.md`
- [ ] Blocked task unblocked (if applicable — remove blocker from its status.md)
```

## Output

- `.plans/{plan-slug}/{task-path}/` directory with task.md and status.md
- Updated overview.md (Task Summary + Defects table)
- Updated blocked task status.md (if applicable)
- All changes committed to main

## Examples

### QA finds a bug in a feature plan

```
User: /add-defect calendar-performance-typescript "Date picker crashes when switching months in Firefox"

Agent:
1. Reads .plans/calendar-performance-typescript/overview.md
2. Finds highest task is task-06, assigns task-07
3. Creates task-07-defect-datepicker-firefox/
4. Updates overview Task Summary and Defects tables
5. Commits to main
6. Reports: "Added defect task-07-defect-datepicker-firefox to calendar-performance-typescript.
   Severity: P2. Doesn't block any existing task. Run /execute-task calendar-performance-typescript/task-07-defect-datepicker-firefox to fix."
```

### QA finds a regression that blocks a task

```
User: /add-defect ip-12998-time-entry-overlap --blocks task-03-verify-consumers "Tech Portal shows raw JSON error instead of user-friendly message"

Agent:
1. Reads the plan, finds task-03 is in-progress
2. Creates task-04-defect-techportal-error-display/
3. Adds blocker to task-03 status.md
4. Updates overview
5. Reports: "Added defect task-04-defect-techportal-error-display. Blocks task-03-verify-consumers
   (marked as blocked). Run /execute-task ip-12998-time-entry-overlap/task-04-defect-techportal-error-display to fix."
```
