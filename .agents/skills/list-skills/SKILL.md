# List Skills

## Context Required
META: no project context needed

## Setup

1. Load `.agents/memory/project-profile.md` (always)
2. Load `.agents/memory/decisions.md` if this skill touches architecture
3. Check `docs/kb/README.md`; read any matching doc before grepping code
4. Explore codebase patterns only after steps 1–3

Skip steps not relevant to this skill's scope.

## Triggers

### Automatic
- None (manual only)

### Manual
- `/list-skills`
- "what skills?", "list skills"
- "what can you do?", "show available skills"
- "what automation do we have?"

## Instructions

### Step 1: Locate skill files
Read SKILL.md files from `.agents/skills/` or `.claude/skills/` directories.
If both directories exist, dedupe by skill `name` and prefer `.agents/skills/` as the primary source.

### Step 2: Extract metadata for each skill
- Skill name (from frontmatter `name` field)
- Description (from frontmatter `description` field)
- Trigger type (Automatic vs Manual from Triggers section)

### Step 3: Format and present

The output below is an **example** of what this skill generates at runtime. The actual list is read dynamically from SKILL.md files — do not treat this as a static template.

```

## Output

- Formatted list of all available skills
- Each entry includes name, description, and trigger summary

## Examples

User: "what commands do we have?"

Agent reads skill definitions and displays the formatted list above.
